                                   <h3> Who is Blythe Williams and <span>Why BigDreamz?</span></h3> 
                                   <p>
                                    
                                    <br>I always had a lot of hobbies and I decided to use those hobbies and do something productive with it.
                                    Capturing moments with photography, telling a story with videography. Promoting businesses with graphic design,
                                    and giving back to the community with basketball skills training. I have more skills I would love to advertise,
                                    but they are still a work in progess.<br>

                                    <br>So, why the name BigDreamz? Honestly, it just has a nice ring to it and it is something I believe we all have.
                                    We all have these dreams that even some of us can possibly say that may be too big to reach, unattainable. However,
                                    I believe that no matter how big your dream may be, we can always find a way to turn it into a reality. So that is 
                                    what my business is all about. Using creativity to turn whatever dreams that you have for a project in mind, and turning
                                    that into a reality. <br>

                                    <br> A little bit more about me and my experience. I have a B.S. in Software Engineering from the University of Texas at
                                    Dallas. I have taken pictures here and there for the past five years or so. I've come to find out I enjoy more of the action
                                    photos because of the ability to really capture the athlete in that mode. I also enjoy videography. It's one of my base level
                                    skills and still needs some room for improvement, but one thing about me is that I have no problem learning and expanding my
                                    horizons. Graphic design is something I have practiced since high school. Whether you need a business card, youtube cover, 
                                    promote your business, or promote an event. The list goes on, but if there is a graphic needed, I'm the one for you! As for 
                                    basketball skills training, I have played basketball ever since I was five years old and I played all the way through college. 
                                    We won a conference championship and I won some individual awards as well. I have a lot of knowledge and my goal is to share that
                                    with upcoming hoopers and give back to the basketball community. Helping increase IQ, confidence, and skill set. <br>

                                    <br>Hopefully, after reading all of this, you get a better idea of what I bring to the table. I hope in the future to do business 
                                    with you soon.<br>
